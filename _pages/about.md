I'm a PhD Candidate at the [Computer Vision Lab](https://vision.ee.ethz.ch/) of
ETH Zurich, supervised by Prof. Luc Van Gool. Currently, I'm also a student
researcher at Google, working in the Perception team in Zurich. 

The focus of my PhD is neural compression, and I've explored learned lossy and
lossless image compression. I'm currently supervising work in video
compression. Prior to working towards a PhD, I recieved a Bachelor and Master
of Science from ETH Zurich, in Electrical Engineering and Information
Technology.
